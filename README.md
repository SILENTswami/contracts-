This smart contract is an implementation of an e-commerce payment system in Solidity, which can be deployed on a blockchain network such as Ethereum.

Functionality
The smart contract has the following functionality:

The owner of the smart contract sets the price of the product during contract deployment.
A customer can send the required amount of ether to purchase the product using the payMoney function.
The customer can check the balance of the smart contract using the getBalance function.
The owner of the smart contract can deliver the product by calling the deliverProduct function after verifying that the customer has sent the correct amount of ether.
The customer can transfer the ether to the owner of the smart contract using the transferFunds function, after verifying that the product has been delivered.
Requirements
This contract requires a blockchain network such as Ethereum to deploy and run.
You need a Solidity compiler to compile the contract code before deploying it on the blockchain network.
Deployment
To deploy this smart contract:

Copy the contract code into a new file and save it with a .sol extension (e.g., E_commerce.sol).
Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler such as Remix or Truffle.
Deploy the compiled contract on the blockchain network of your choice.
Usage
After deploying the smart contract, you can interact with it using a blockchain wallet such as MetaMask or MyEtherWallet. The following are the steps to use the smart contract:

Open your blockchain wallet and connect it to the network on which the smart contract is deployed.
Access the smart contract by providing its address.
Use the functions of the smart contract to purchase the product and transfer the payment to the owner.
